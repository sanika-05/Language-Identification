Text preprocessing
1. Converted text to lowercase.
2. Removed emojis and special characters , which were present in sentences like        ♪ dije, le dije: Dije, vamos ♪
3. Replaced text within angular brackets(<>) with space, this removed  HTML tags.
4. Replaced text within square brackets ([]) with space, did not remove square brackets at the start of the sentence. This helped in removing citations.
5. Removed URLs, 'https' and 'www.'.
6. Removed numbers, hyphens and punctuations.
7. Replaced space with underscore for using char analyser.


Used CountVectorizer with analyser = 'char' , ngram_range = (5,6)
Model used Multinomial Naive Bayes with alpha = 0.00001


I have not discussed the assignment with anyone.


I have taken a few ideas from the following report.
